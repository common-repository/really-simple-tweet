Adds simple function to send a tweet. Accepts Twitter username and password as parameters, or gets them from Twitter Tools if available.

Twitter Tools is great but currently lacks a simple function to send a Tweet from your site's PHP. This plugin adds such a function, so you can send a Tweet by calling the function from your site's PHP.
